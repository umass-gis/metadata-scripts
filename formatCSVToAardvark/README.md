# Format CSV to Aardvark
This Python script reads a CSV containing basic geospatial metadata and reformats it according to the GeoBlacklight Aardvark metadata schema. The script is designed to format the output from `mergeCSVs.py`.

Documentation about the Aardvark schema is in the works, as the schema has yet to be rolled out officially. To learn more about the current metadata schema (1.0), see the [GeoBlacklight metadata wiki](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/wiki/Metadata).
