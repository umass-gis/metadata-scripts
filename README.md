# Metadata Scripts
Scripts for processing metadata for GeoData, UMass Amherst's GeoBlacklight repository. All scripts are designed to work with the Aardvark metadata schema.

## extractFGDCXMLToCSV.py
This script iterates through multiple XML files generated by the "Export Metadata Multiple" tool in ArcMap, retrieves each item's title and bounding coordinates, and generates a single CSV file with this information. The script is designed to extract relevant information about a georeferenced raster (aerial photo), and so it will need to be customized before the script can be used for other XML files. These are the fields which are extracted:
* title
* identifier (calculated field based on title) - input to `dct_identifier_sm`
* west bounding coordinate
* east bounding coordinate
* north bounding coordinate
* south bounding coordinate
* bb (calculated field based on bounding coordinates) – input to `locn_geometry`
