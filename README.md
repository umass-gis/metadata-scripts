# OGM Aardvark Metadata Scripts
Scripts for creating geospatial metadata in the [OpenGeoMetadata Aardvark](https://opengeometadata.org) metadata schema for UMass Amherst's [GeoBlacklight](https://geoblacklight.org) repository. The workflow is designed to generate metadata for a collection of georeferenced aerial photos in the [UMass Amherst MacConnell Aerial Photo Collection](https://credo.library.umass.edu/view/collection/mufs190).

## Required inputs

* Individual XML files for each resource generated by the [Export Metadata Multiple](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/conversion-toolbox/export-metadata-multiple.htm) tool in ArcMap, containing bounding coordinates and a unique ID (or information that can be transformed into a unique ID)
* One or more CSV files with additional metadata, each row containing a unique ID

## Workflow

| Step | Script | Summary |
|:-----|:-------|:--------|
| 1    | [extractXMLToCSVGetGeoNames.py](#step-1-extract-xml-to-csv-and-get-geonames) | Iterates through multiple XML files containing bounding coordinates, extracts relevant data based on tags, uses API queries to retrieve coverage information from the GeoNames database, and aggregates the information into a single CSV. |
| 2    | [mergeCSVs.py](#step-2-merge-csvs) | Merges the output from Step 1 with another CSV containing additional metadata, based on a shared unique ID. |
| 3    | [formatCSVtoAardvark.py](#step-3-format-csv-to-aardvark) | Formats the output from Step 2 into the OGM Aardvark metadata schema. |
| 4    | [parseCSVToMultipleJSONs.py](#step-4-parse-csv-to-multiple-jsons) | Parses the output from Step 3 into multiple JSON files (one per item) that can be ingested into GeoBlacklight applications. |

## Step 1: Extract XML to CSV and Get GeoNames
This Python script iterates through multiple XML files generated by the [Export Metadata Multiple](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/conversion-toolbox/export-metadata-multiple.htm) tool in ArcMap. It retrieves each item's title and bounding coordinates, uses API queries to collect placename information from the [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org) database, then generates a single CSV file with the aggregated information.

The script uses two APIs:
* [Cities and Placenames](https://www.geonames.org/export/JSON-webservices.html#citiesJSON) collects all the GeoName IDs of major populated places within a photo's bounding coordinates
* [Hierarchy](https://www.geonames.org/export/place-hierarchy.html#hierarchy) collects all the GeoName IDs of upper hierarchy of the most relevant populated place within the photo's bounding coordinates

### Output Fields

These are the fields that are extracted and/or calculated:

| Field        | Description                                                      | Matching field in OGM Aardvark |
|:-------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| `mods_ID`    | Unique identifier                                                | `dct_identifier_sm`            |
| `spatial`    | Place names covered by the resource (if found, otherwise 'none') | `dct_spatial_sm`               |
| `geometry`   | Extent of the resource, formatted as "ENVELOPE(W, E, N, S)"      | `locn_geometry`                |
| `bbox`       | Bounding box, also formatted as "ENVELOPE(W, E, N, S)"           | `dcat_bbox`                    |
| `place`      | Populated Place from the GeoNames database                       |                                |
| `town`       | ADM3 from the GeoNames database                                  |                                |
| `county`     | ADM2 from the GeoNames database                                  |                                |
| `state`      | ADM1 from the GeoNames database                                  |                                |
| `geoname_ID` | GeoName IDs (if found, otherwise 'none')                         | `umass_geonames_s`             |

### Customizations
`cols` - update this list with the column headings that should appear in the output CSV. These fields will need to be edited for the variable `this_df` as well.

`citeinfo` and `bounding` - these parts of the script use the xml.etree.ElementTree library to search for information within the XML file based on specific tags.
* For XML files with multiple children, see the Python docs help on [Parsing XML](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#parsing-xml)
* For locating buried elements in a tree, see the Python docs help on [XPath support](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xpath-support)

`geometry` - formats the output as a bounding box in the format `ENVELOPE(W,E,N,S)`. However, starting in GeoBlacklight 4.0 this field can be formatted as a complex geometry, which becomes the default polygon shown in the map interface. See the OGM Aardvark metadata schema for more information about the [`locn_geometry`](https://opengeometadata.org/docs/ogm-aardvark/geometry) field.

`spatial` - creates a list that rearranges the GeoNames parts into a custom format: `["Amherst, MA", "Town of Amherst, MA", "Hampshire County, MA"]`. These elements can be rearranged to create whatever format you prefer. See the OGM Aaardvark metadata schema for more information about the [`dct_spatial_sm`](https://opengeometadata.org/docs/ogm-aardvark/spatial-coverage) field.

`this_df` - there are several calculated fields that format the extracted title and coordinate information according to the [OGM Aaardvark](https://opengeometadata.org) metadata schema.

`username` - to use the GeoNames API, you must [create a GeoNames username](http://www.geonames.org/login). Running the script with the default username ("demo") will likely not return any results.

## Step 2: Merge CSVs
This Python script merges three CSVs based on the unique ID, `mods_ID`. The script is is designed to merge the output from `1_extractXMLToCSVGetGeoNames.py` with additional metadata from the [UMass Amherst MacConnell Aerial Photo collection](https://credo.library.umass.edu/view/collection/mufs190).

### Output Fields

These are the fields that are extracted and/or calculated (in addition to those above):

| Field        | Description                                                      | Matching field in OGM Aardvark |
|:-------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| `titleInfo_partNumber` | Photo ID from original metadata record                 |                                |
| `place_placeTerm`      | Spatial coverage from original metadata record         |                                |
| `dateCreated`          | Creation date from original metadata record            | `dct_temporal_sm` and `dct_issued_s` |
| `year`                 | Creation year from original metadata record            | `gbl_indexYear_im`             |
| `annotation` | Note about whether or not the photo has markings                 | `umass_annotated_s`            |

## Step 3: Format CSV to Aardvark
This Python script reads a CSV containing basic geospatial metadata and reformats it according to the [OGM Aardvark](https://opengeometadata.org) metadata schema. The script is designed to format the output from `2_mergeCSVs.py`.

For an example of how to format an input CSV for this script, check out the file `test_data_2_merged.csv` in the [test data pack](https://github.com/umass-gis/metadata-scripts/blob/main/test_data.zip).

### Customizations
`cols` - this list contains all the OGM Aardvark fields, as well as custom UMass fields. Fields you don't want can be commented out.

*Reading the CSV* - this list contains the column headings from the CSV. Make sure to add any columns that contain Aardvark-ready metadata.

*Appending to `cols`* - this list contains all the same fields as in `cols` above. Fields you don't want can be commented out. The rest will need to be updated based on your own desired outputs. Note that for the UMass Amherst workflow, we are working with a set of historical aerial photographs that are for the most part similar; therefore we are using this part of the script to populate many fields with identical information. Alternatively, you might create a CSV with all the OGM Aardvark information, then customize this part of the script to simply read the CSV and write its contents to the fields.

## Step 4: Parse CSV to Multiple JSONs
This Python script reads a CSV containing [OGM Aardvark](https://opengeometadata.org) metadata and parses it into individual GeoJSON files for each record. The script is designed to parse the output from `3_formatCSVToAardvark.py`.

For an example of how to format an input CSV for this script, check out the file `test_data_3_aardvark.csv` in the [test data pack](https://github.com/umass-gis/metadata-scripts/blob/main/test_data.zip).

### Customizations

`mods_ID` - the unique ID that we use in naming the output file. You can substitute any other field, or change this part of the code to name output files as you wish.

## Try it yourself!
To try out the scripts, the [test_data.zip](https://github.com/umass-gis/metadata-scripts/blob/main/test_data.zip) package contains 6 sample XML files of georeferenced aerial photos and the files `scua.csv` and `annotation.csv` with additional metadata about the full aerial photo collection.

You'll need to download the individual Python scripts and save them in the same folder, and then use your favorite Python application to run the scripts (like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)).
